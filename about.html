        <p>
          We are a company that has been open from January 2018. You might wonder from where we came up with such a creative name as "ASK".
          Well, there is only one simple response to that question and to know you simply just ASK us if you want to buy anything and it is also very catchy and  easy to remember.
        </p>
        <p class="dark">
          Our warehouse contains more than 3000 products from Socks and Gloves to Tobacco products. To buy products there are 2 options that you can choose. 1 of them being Delivery and the other being Carry-Out.
          When it comes to pricing, you bet we are the best in CT. This might sound bias but honesty is our first priority. This may sound a bit repetitive but it is really true.
          We even give our customers a 1 week period to pay in instances such as them forgetting their wallet or just not having the money. In case that happens, we give our customers a surety bond when they do not pay in full if the customer walks in.
          We also have discounts up to 30% storewide. If we see you a lot and see that we are your primary supplier/distributor then we give you a special discount on rare products.
